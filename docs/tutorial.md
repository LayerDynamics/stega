# Tutorial: Building a Custom CLI with Stega

In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating a simple CLI application using the Stega CLI Framework.

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Create a new directory for your CLI application and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-cli-app
cd my-cli-app
```

## Step 2: Install Stega

Install Stega using Deno's install command:

```bash
deno install --allow-all --unstable https://deno.land/x/stega@v1.0.0/mod.ts -n stega
```

This command installs Stega globally, allowing you to use the `stega` command from anywhere.

## Step 3: Create a New Command

Create a `hello.ts` file to define a new command:

```typescript
// hello.ts
import { CLI, Command } from "https://deno.land/x/stega@v1.0.0/mod.ts";

const cli = new CLI();

// Define the 'hello' command
const helloCommand: Command = {
  name: "hello",
  description: "Say hello",
  options: [
    { name: "name", alias: "n", type: "string", required: true },
    { name: "excited", alias: "e", type: "boolean", default: false },
  ],
  action: (args) => {
    const name = args.flags.name;
    const excited = args.flags.excited;
    const greeting = excited ? `Hello, ${name}!!!` : `Hello, ${name}!`;
    console.log(greeting);
  },
};

// Register the 'hello' command
cli.register(helloCommand);

// Run the CLI
await cli.run();
```

**Explanation:**

- **helloCommand:**
  - **Options:**
    - `--name` (`-n`): Required string flag for the user's name.
    - `--excited` (`-e`): Optional boolean flag to add excitement to the greeting.
  - **Action:**
    - Logs a greeting message based on the `excited` flag.

## Step 4: Run Your CLI

Execute the `hello` command with the required flag:

```bash
deno run --allow-all hello.ts hello --name=World
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, World!
```

Enable the `excited` flag:

```bash
deno run --allow-all hello.ts hello --name=World --excited
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, World!!!
```

## Step 5: Add Help

Use the `--help` flag to see available commands and options:

```bash
deno run --allow-all hello.ts --help
```

**Output:**

```
Available Commands:
  hello	Say hello

Use "stega help [command]" for more information on a specific command.
```

Get help for the `hello` command:

```bash
deno run --allow-all hello.ts help hello
```

**Output:**

```
Command: hello

Say hello

Options:
  --name, -n	Name of the user (required)
  --excited, -e	Enable excited output (default: false)

Usage:
  stega hello [options]
```

## Step 6: Configure Default Values

Create a `config.json` file to set default values for flags:

```json
{
  "excited": true
}
```

Now, running the command without the `--excited` flag will use the default value from the configuration:

```bash
deno run --allow-all hello.ts greet --name=Alice
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, Alice!!!
```

## Step 7: Conclusion

You've successfully created a simple CLI application using the Stega CLI Framework! Explore adding more commands, subcommands, and options to enhance your CLI's functionality.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€

## **5. Packaging and Distribution**

To make Stega accessible to others, we'll package and distribute it via `deno.land/x`.

### **a. Publishing to `deno.land/x`**

**Steps:**

1. **Ensure Repository is Properly Tagged:**

   - Commit all changes and push them to GitHub.
   - Create a new release with a semantic version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

2. **Accessing the Module:**

   After tagging, Stega will be available at:

   ```
   https://deno.land/x/stega@v1.0.0/mod.ts
   ```

3. **Installation Instructions:**

   Update the `README.md` to guide users on how to install Stega:

   ```markdown
   ## Installation

   Install Stega using Deno's install command:

   ```bash
   deno install --allow-all --unstable https://deno.land/x/stega@v1.0.0/mod.ts -n stega
   ```
   ```

**Note:**
Ensure that your GitHub repository is public and follows Deno's naming conventions for modules.

## **6. Maintenance and Community Building**

Building a community around Stega encourages contributions, feedback, and continuous improvement.

### **a. Issue Tracking**

Utilize GitHub Issues to manage bugs, feature requests, and discussions. Encourage users to report issues and suggest enhancements.
